  ## Description

Creating the React Frontend: Immerse yourself in the world of React development as we craft a dynamic and adaptable user interface. Gain valuable insights on organizing your components and effectively managing state using React hooks.

Crafting the Node.js Backend: Delve into the backend realm with Node.js as we construct a robust API to handle data requests from our React frontend. We'll utilize Express.js to streamline the process.

Leveraging AWS Services: Discover the capabilities of AWS by seamlessly integrating services such as Lambda for serverless functions to host our API, Amplify for hosting our frontend, and DynamoDB for managing our database.

Deploying Your Application: Follow our step-by-step guide as we deploy our full-stack application to AWS. We utilize cost-effective services, making it virtually free to host our application. (You may incur minimal charges, typically just a few cents.)
